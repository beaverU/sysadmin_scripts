# sysadmin_scripts
Here I store bash &amp; python scripts that could automate some manual tasks for a beginner system administrator.
# Structure
- `00_education` - is my working directory where I'm trying new concepts and bash syntax on examples
- `01_cve_check` - is a directory for scripts designed to evaluate pending package upgrades based on their CVE scores
