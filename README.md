# sysadmin_scripts

Here I store Bash and Python scripts that help automate manual tasks for beginner system administrators.

## Structure

- `00_education` - is my working directory where I experiment with new concepts and Bash syntax using examples
- `01_cve_check` - is a directory for scripts designed to evaluate pending package upgrades based on their CVE scores
- `10_config_files` - is a compilation of my favorite `.config` files and settings
